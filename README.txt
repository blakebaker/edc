	This Program was written for a Project in my CPSC485
 Bioinformatics Class. It was to take two words from the user
 and Calculate the edit distance between them. All penalties
 Were assessed at +1 to the score. Matches were assessed at 0.
 
 Input: Two strings from a user.
 Output: Two words, Edit Distance Score, Alignment Grid, 
	Alignment Path, and Alignment.


-----------------II. Notes -----------------------------

1. I tried to implement a recurring program so you did 
not have to rerun every time but ran into problems with 
user input. This will be a feature added later.

 5. Press any Key to exit.
 6. Rerun the executable to execute more words.

*For Large input you may have to scroll up on console.
